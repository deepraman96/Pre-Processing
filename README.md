#Dataset Pre- Processing for cleaning the dataset
This is the code for dataset cleaning the program will be able to perform followig tasks:
- Eliminating Null Values.
- Evaluating Occurance Of individual Application in the dataset
- Selecting appropriate sample size
- the resulted dataset will be able to undergo any supervised machine learning algorithm. 
- the program can be used for different datasets but with appropriate number of features present in it.

I have used existed dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps/code"
The dataset was gathered by the Universidad Del Cauca, Popayán, Colombia network department. The information was acquired via Internet packet collection in different time and day intervals. In numbers 3.577.296 instances exist in the dataset. This dataset comprises 75 apps with mixed Internet traffic, containing over 87 functions. The dataset is labelled with IP flows and is saved in csv file-format by their application protocols. Each case provides IP packet flow information with its features such as – source address, destination addresses, source/destination port numbers, interval timings, protocol used etc
